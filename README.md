## Introduction
The Gantt Chart Creator is a simple web application that enables users to generate Gantt charts for various scheduling algorithms. It provides a visual representation of the scheduling process, allowing users to understand the order of execution and analyze metrics such as waiting time and response time.

- Supports multiple scheduling algorithms: FCFS, SJF, RR, Priority Scheduling (Preemptive and Non-Preemptive).
- Option to choose between preemptive and non-preemptive modes for applicable algorithms.
- Visual representation of Gantt chart with process execution timelines.
- Calculation and display of average waiting time and average response time.

## Usage
1. Open the application in a web browser.
2. Enter process times separated by commas in the "Process Times" input field.
3. Optionally, enter priorities (for Priority Scheduling) separated by commas in the "Priorities" input field.
4. If using Round Robin (RR) scheduling, enter the time quantum in the corresponding input field.
5. Select preemptive or non-preemptive mode from the dropdown menu.
6. Choose the scheduling algorithm from the dropdown menu.
7. Click on the "Generate Gantt Chart" button to create the chart.
8. View the generated Gantt chart and metrics in the results section.
